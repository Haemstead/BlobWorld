# BlobWorld
A simple ecosystem based on Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code

This ecosystem was programmed in Processing, after reading chapter "Vectors" of The Nature of Code.

The ecosystem consists of a set of creatures called Blobs, who move through their world by expanding and contracting their bodies.
While contracting its body, a Blob exerts a force that give it an acceleration in the direction of the mouse. The force depends on the body-mass of the Blob, and of the amount of contraction.
